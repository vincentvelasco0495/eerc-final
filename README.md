To set up your local server:

- **Guide:** [https://docs.minimals.cc/mock-server](https://docs.minimals.cc/mock-server).

- **Resource:** [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/bopqsyaatc8fbquswxwww/AKgu6V6ZGmxtu22MuzsL5L4?rlkey=8s55vnilwz2d8nsrcmdo2a6ci&dl=0).

## Full version

- Create React App ([migrate to CRA](https://docs.minimals.cc/migrate-to-cra/)).
- Next.js
- Vite.js

## Starter version

- To remove unnecessary components. This is a simplified version ([https://starter.minimals.cc/](https://starter.minimals.cc/))
- Good to start a new project. You can copy components from the full version.
- Make sure to install the dependencies exactly as compared to the full version.

**NOTE:**
_When copying folders remember to also copy hidden files like .env. This is important because .env files often contain environment variables that are crucial for the application to run correctly._
